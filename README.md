### 🧠 Project Context

This project was built early in my learning journey as a way to:

- Understand component-based UI development

- Work with third-party REST APIs

- Implement routing and nested routes

- Experiment with infinite scrolling and dynamic layouts

While the core idea and UI remain the same, the codebase has been revisited to:

- Remove unnecessary complexity

- Improve state management and data flow

- Eliminate deprecated patterns

- Better align with modern React and React Router practices
